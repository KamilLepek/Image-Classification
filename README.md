# Image-Classification

In this repository I'm trying to solve the problem of MNIST handwritten digits dataset classification with various algorithms. My goal is to train some convolutional neural networks and learn about deep learning in general. [MNIST handwritten digit databse.](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

I'll try to update this list soon :).

* [Nearest Neighbour Algorithm](NearestNeighbour.R)

* [3-Layer Neural Network](3_Layer_Neural_Network.py) in python with tensorflow computed on GPU CUDA cores and the [logs](3_Layer_Neural_Network_LOGS)
