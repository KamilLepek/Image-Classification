# Image-Classification

In this repository I'm trying to solve the problem of MNIST handwritten digits dataset classification with various algorithms. [MNIST handwritten digit databse.](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

* [Nearest Neighbour Algorithm](NearestNeighbour.R)

* [3-Layer Neural Network](3_Layer_Neural_Network.py) in python with tensorflow computed on GPU CUDA cores and the [logs](3_Layer_Neural_Network_LOGS)
